# Peer review for Kate Huntsman
[Jupyter workbook](https://github.com/katehuntsman/midterm/blob/main/classification.ipynb)

## Clarity and Organization
- Great introduction I was prepared to know what I was going to look at next
- Your README.md was really well organized and easy to read
- There were a couple of instances where errors were printed out in section 2.2. I have also run into errors like that and did not really understand why. If you put those errors into your favorite AI assistant they are usually able to direct you how to correct and it will make your workbook look more professional though the errors do not appear to have effected any results.
- Overall really nice job organizing the project the numbering of your sections helped keep everything clean

## Feature Selection and Justification
- Goal from introduction is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poinsonous
- I could be incorrect but it looks like all features were selected not just some of the features
- Your justification is sound though in your refletion you stated they are esential for determining whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous

## Model Performance and Comparisons
- Confusion matrix was used with a perfect 1 score in all categories
- Logistic Regression Performance was used with a perfect 1 score in all categories
- Random Forest Performance was used with a perfect 1 score in all categories
- These perfect scores support that possibly features were not selected properly earlier as since all features were selected there was no train or testing to be done
- In section 4 you did mention a possibility of overfitting with the 100% recall

## Reflecion Quality
- Your reflections were inciteful, thorough, and really brought your project together
- I enjoyed reading your entire summary section very well thought out and explanatory
